<!-- <a href='https://ashy-pebble-081011310.1.azurestaticapps.net/'>:smiley: click for demo</a> -->
### Problem Statement/Opportunity*: 
Due to pandemic of covid19 everyone is affected and moving toward online travelling and services there are lots of queries regarding guidelines, safety, myths, vaccination info and many more. But because of unfriendly interface of online  service provider most of the people find it difficult to search their Q@A directly .
which increases unnecessary crowd, to solve this issue I build a user-friendly full stack web app to solve their quarries online easily.

## Project Description*:
A)	The core idea of the project is to build a full-stack user friendly interface website with the help of Azure web app bot, app service and host with static web app
